# AGENT
# da Finnci agent
#
# INTRODUCTION
# This agent is based on Tit for Tat, but has a number of special behaviours implemented for different scenarios.
#
# STRATEGY
# Normally the agent follows Tit for Tat.
#
# If the opponent at some point defects but later follows TFT, a revenge cycle is possible.
# This agent can detect and break it. If the attempt to break it was unsuccessful,
# the agent tries again at increasing intervals
#
# If a total war takes place - both parties keep defecting - then this agent makes a strong effort to break it.
# If unsuccessful the attempt will be repeated at increasing intervals.
#
# If the opponent often answers with defecting to friendly behaviour this agent starts a strict punishment.
# This is a countermeasure against randomness.
#
# If the opponent keeps alternating this agent starts always defecting.
