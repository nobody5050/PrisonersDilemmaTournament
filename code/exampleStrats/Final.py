	# A finite state machine detective. 
	# It tries to figure out what the oponent is thinking,
	# and if it cant, it becomes a tit-for-tat
	#
	# TODO list
	# [X] Finite state machine
	# [X] Behave like a tft while detecting
	# [X] Handle randoms
	# [?] Break out of D/D loops
	# [ ] Detect fibbonachi (ahh how do you spell that)
	# [ ] Maybe swap tft for another variant, unsure as of now
	# [X] Submit
	#
	# Also, cary if you're reading this a few things:
	# 1. I'd love to see another version if this contest 
	# with a chance of misscomunication, 
	# as well as some other highly requested features
	#
	# 2. Although I doubt i'll win, if I do then I want to explain
	# more about this strategy. *please* contact me so i can
	# explain it to you in more details than I can include in this
	# simple readme.
	#
	# 3. Thanks for hosting such an amazing contest!
	# I met so many cool people though this and the atmosphere
	# inside the discord, with so many wonderful minds working
	# together is truly phenominal. I'm not exagerating when I say
	# that this week has truly changed my life.
	#
	# Thank you.
